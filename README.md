# Zora by Travis

**Zora by Travis** is a unified NFT minting platform that allows users to mint NFTs through the web or a selected social media platform (Telegram, Discord, or Twitter). The web version includes advanced features like image generation by combining two Zora coins.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Mint NFTs via one chosen social media platform (Telegram, Discord, or Twitter)
- Upload and preview files for minting via a modern web interface
- Generate new NFT images by merging traits from two Zora tokens (web-only feature)
- Store metadata securely and interact with the Zora protocol
